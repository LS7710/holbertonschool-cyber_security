## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 0. The Case of the Mysterious Image
- Used `exiftool` to analyze an image and extract hidden metadata (e.g., author or device info).

### 1. Unraveling Location Clues from Image Metadata
- Extracted embedded GPS coordinates from image metadata and mapped the location using Google Maps.

### 2. Deciphering the Intruder's Intent
- Analyzed SSH login anomalies and network command history to determine the attacker's primary goal.

### 3. Identifying the Vulnerability Type
- Investigated a data breach involving malicious input in a web login form to identify SQL Injection (SQLi).

### 4. Pinpointing the Attack Method
- Determined that a known vulnerability on a remote service led to the web server compromise.

### 5. Unveiling the Ripple Effect
- Interpreted subtle changes in customer profiles to identify potential loss of trust and brand damage.
